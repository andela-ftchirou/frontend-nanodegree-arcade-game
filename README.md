===============================

Frogger game clone (much simpler) made for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001.

There is a playable version of the game at <a href="http://andela-ftchirou.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/" target="_blank">http://andela-ftchirou.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/</a>

## How to run
There is nothing special to do in order to run the game. Just open index.html in your favorite browser.
The game requires jquery 1.11.1 and bootstrap 3.3 to display information on the page, but they are already
included (js and css directories).

## How to play
First select a character and move him on a grass block at the top row of the board to clear a level.

### Keyboard controls
* **Left arrow** moves the player or the character selector to the left.
* **Right arrow** moves the player or the character selector to the right.
* **Up arrow** moves the player up.
* **Down arrow** moves the player down.
* **h** for help, an item will appear on the board if this key is pressed.
* **p** pauses or resumes the game.
* **q** quits the game and shows the character selection screen.

### Items
It is possible to collect some items in the game. Some levels can't even be cleared without them. Most items effects last only 1 second. The items available are:
* **Heart** an additional life.
* **Star** makes the player indestructible.
* **Key** unlocks immediately the next level.
* **Stone** turns water blocks in stone blocks.
* **Blue Gem** slows down the enemies.
